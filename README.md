Every time you want to file a freedom of information request to the Canadian federal government (through either the [old portal](https://atip-aiprp.apps.gc.ca/atip/welcome.do?lang=en) or the [new one](https://atip-aiprp.tbs-sct.gc.ca/en/Home/Welcome)), you must manually fill out an annoying form with your contact information (the form doesn’t work well with browsers’ autofill). This bookmarklet makes the process easier by pre-filling out all the fields.

To install the bookmarklet, go to the URL below, fill out the form, then drag the button into your bookmarks bar and you’re good to go. The personal information (mailing address, phone number, etc.) you plug into the site won’t be sent anywhere and will never leave your browser.

This bookmarklet will only work in latest versions of desktop Chrome and Firefox.
